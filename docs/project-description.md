- `/app/globals.css`: Global styles
- `/app/api/`: API routes

## Component Relationships

### Data Flow

1. **User Input Flow**:

   - Users input salary data through `PayPointForm.tsx`
   - Data is centrally managed by `useSalaryData.ts` hook, which integrates functionality that was previously split across multiple hooks
   - The `useSalaryData` hook handles validation, data transformation, and memoizes calculations for performance
   - Results are displayed in charts and summaries

2. **Visualization Flow**:

   - Raw data is processed by hooks in the features directory
   - `usePaypointChartData.ts` transforms data for chart consumption
   - `ResponsiveChartWrapper.tsx` determines which chart to display
   - Either `DesktopPayChart.tsx` or `MobilePayChart.tsx` renders the data

3. **Tax Calculation Flow**:

   - Salary data is processed by `taxCalculator.ts`
   - Configuration from `YEARLY_TAX_CONFIG.ts` and `TRYGDE_CONFIG.ts` is applied
   - Results are displayed in `TaxSummary.tsx`

4. **Inflation Analysis Flow**:
   - Inflation data is fetched through the API route
   - Data is processed by `inflationCalc.ts` and `inflationParser.ts`
   - `useInflation.ts` hook provides the processed data to components
   - Charts visualize the inflation impact on salary

### State Management

1. **Display Mode Context**:

   - `DisplayModeContext.tsx` manages the toggle between net and gross salary modes
   - Persists user preference in localStorage
   - Provides context across the application

2. **Local Component State**:

   - Each component maintains its own state for UI interactions
   - Custom hooks manage feature-specific state
   - `useSalaryData.ts` provides a unified interface for salary-related state management

3. **Data Fetching**:
   - The SWR library is used for data fetching and caching
   - API routes provide server-side data processing

## Configuration and Utilities

The project uses several configuration files and utilities:

- **Tax and Social Security Configuration**:

  - `YEARLY_TAX_CONFIG.ts` defines tax brackets and rates
  - `TRYGDE_CONFIG.ts` defines social security contribution rates

- **Scripts**:

  - Various scripts in the `/scripts` directory for calculating specific tax components:
    - `get_bracket.js`
    - `get_general_income.js`
    - `get_standard_deduction.js`
    - `get_surtax.js`
    - `get_trygdeavgift.js`

- **Constants**:
  - Text constants in `lib/constants/text.ts`
  - Chart.js configuration in `lib/chartjs.ts`

## Recent Refactoring Work

### Unified State Management

The application recently underwent refactoring to improve code organization and performance:

1. **Unified Salary Data Hook**:

   - Created `useSalaryData.ts` hook that combines functionality from multiple hooks
   - Implemented proper memoization for calculations to reduce unnecessary re-renders
   - Added consistent validation patterns for user input

2. **Tax Calculation Optimization**:

   - Added caching via `taxService.ts` to avoid redundant calculations
   - Improved type safety with consolidated types in `/lib/models/types.ts`

3. **Type System Improvements**:

   - Consolidated related types in a central location
   - Enhanced component interfaces for better type checking

4. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Fixed issues with the loading states in `app/page.tsx`
   - Implemented proper wrapper functions to ensure type compatibility between hooks and components

## Recent Modifications

### Salary Editing Fix (May 20, 2025)

Fixed a bug where editing a salary entry would sometimes result in a duplicate year error. The issue was resolved by:

1. Ensuring that the PayPoint ID is properly preserved and used during the editing process
2. Updating the validation logic in DataEntryGuide.client.tsx to correctly handle year duplication checks
3. Improving the editPoint function in useSalaryData.ts to use IDs for point identification when available
4. Fixed a React warning for an unnecessary dependency in the useMemo hook

This fix ensures users can now edit their salary entries without encountering the "You already have a payment for (year)" error when editing an entry without changing its year.

### Stats Cards Layout Improvement (May 20, 2025)

Improved the responsive layout of the stats cards to optimize space usage across different screen sizes:

1. Changed from a 2-column grid to a 4-column grid on desktop screens for a more compact single-row layout
2. Maintained 2-column grid on mobile for better readability on smaller screens
3. Optimized padding and text sizes to ensure all information is easily readable on all devices
4. Made the stats cards container take the full width of the parent container for better alignment

These changes improve the user interface by using screen space more efficiently while maintaining a clean, readable layout across all device sizes.

## [2025-05-20] Type Consolidation

- Removed the duplicate `SalaryDataPoint` interface from `features/inflation/inflationCalc.ts`.
- Now using the shared `SalaryDataPoint` type from `lib/models/types.ts` throughout the codebase for consistency and maintainability.
- All other interfaces/types remain local or private unless they are used across multiple features, in line with separation of concerns and to avoid circular imports.

## Conclusion

This application provides a comprehensive solution for salary and tax planning with a focus on Norwegian tax rules and inflation impacts. The feature-based architecture promotes:

1. **Cohesive organization**: Related code is grouped together
2. **Separation of concerns**: Each feature module is self-contained
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to one feature minimally impact others
4. **Scalability**: New features can be added with minimal changes to existing code
5. **Performance**: Memoization and caching strategies reduce unnecessary calculations

The application is built with responsive design principles, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

- Decoupled, best-practice React/Next.js frontend.
- No new libraries without justification.
- All user-facing text in `lib/constants/text.ts`.
- Code is easily testable.
- Use `bun` for app commands.

## [2025-05-21] User Data Reset & Last Tab Persistence

- The reset function (triggered from the footer) now clears all app-specific localStorage keys, including:
  - Salary points (`salary-calculator-points`)
  - Display mode (`salaryDisplayMode`)
  - Onboarding flags (`salary-onboarding-v1`, `salary-calculator-onboarded`)
  - Negotiation tab state (`negotiation_data_points`, `negotiation_data_email`, `negotiation_data_playbook`, `negotiation_data_email_count`, `negotiation_data_playbook_count`)
  - Last active tab (`salary-last-tab`)
- This ensures a true reset of all user data and state.
- The HomeClient now persists the last active tab to localStorage and restores it for returning users, improving user experience.
- These changes further decouple user state management and make the app easier to maintain and test.

## [2025-05-21] UI Library Simplification

- Removed DaisyUI dependency in favor of custom-styled Tailwind components
- Replaced DaisyUI-specific components with standard React implementations
- Enhanced the custom CollapsibleSection component for email and playbook outputs
- Simplified overall dependency management and reduced package size
- Improved customization options by using standard Tailwind classes directly
- This change aligns better with the project's goal of having a minimal dependency footprint

## [2025-05-21] Centralized AI Prompt Builders

- Factored out prompt construction for AI SDK routes into `lib/prompts.ts`.
- API routes for email and playbook generation now use these shared prompt builder functions.
- This improves maintainability and ensures all prompt logic is in one place, following separation of concerns.

---

## Negotiation Tab Changes

### Overview

- **Copy Markdown Button:** Added a Copy Markdown button to both the generated email and playbook output sections in the negotiation tab.
- The button allows users to copy the original markdown output for inspection, with user feedback for success or error.
- Text for the button and feedback is managed in `lib/constants/text.ts`.
- The button is placed next to the section headings for both outputs, following modern UI/UX best practices.

### Negotiation Feature (`/features/negotiation/`)

- **Components**
  - `NegotiationTab.client.tsx`: Main negotiation UI, including user info, argument entry, and output generation
  - `NegotiationUserInfoForm.tsx`: User info form for negotiation context
- **Hooks**
  - `useNegotiationData.ts`: Manages negotiation points, output generation, and generation limits

#### Recent Enhancements (May 21, 2025)

- Email and playbook outputs are now rendered in custom collapsible sections with a clean, accessible interface
- Added copy as rich text (HTML) and download as DOCX buttons for both outputs, supporting pasting into Outlook/Word and offline use
- Markdown rendering uses GitHub's light theme for consistent appearance
- All new UI text is managed in `lib/constants/text.ts`
- Improved the CollapsibleSection component with better accessibility and keyboard support
- Enhanced UI with standard Tailwind classes for better maintainability

## Negotiation Tab Refresh Safety

The negotiation tab now persists the following state to localStorage for refresh safety:

- emailContent
- playbookContent
- emailPrompt
- playbookPrompt

On mount, these values are hydrated from localStorage if present. This ensures that generated negotiation outputs and prompts are not lost on page refresh or navigation.

# Negotiation Feature Refactor (May 2025)

## Overview

The negotiation feature was refactored to improve separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability. The main component (`NegotiationTab.client.tsx`) was split into smaller, focused subcomponents and utility files. This aligns with our frontend best practices for React/Next.js and the project's coding principles.

## New Structure

- **NegotiationTab.client.tsx**: Orchestrates the negotiation UI, manages state, and composes subcomponents.
- **NegotiationPointsInput.tsx**: Handles the input for adding new negotiation points.
- **NegotiationPointsList.tsx**: Renders the list of negotiation points and handles removal.
- **CopyPromptButton.tsx**: Button for copying prompt text to clipboard.
- **CopyRichButton.tsx**: Button for copying rich (HTML) content to clipboard.
- **DownloadDocxButton.tsx**: Button for downloading generated content as a .docx file.
- **CollapsibleSection.tsx**: Collapsible UI section for outputs.
- **utils/negotiationUtils.ts**: Utility for converting markdown to docx paragraphs.

## Reasoning

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component now has a single responsibility, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- **Type Safety**: All new components use explicit TypeScript types for props.
- **Reusability**: Utility and UI logic (copy/download/collapsible) are reusable across the negotiation feature.
- **Testability**: Smaller components are easier to test in isolation.

## Usage

- The main negotiation tab imports and composes the subcomponents.
- All user-facing text remains in `lib/constants/text.ts`.
- No new libraries were introduced; only internal refactoring was performed.

## Next Steps

- Add tests for each subcomponent.
- Continue to follow this decoupled structure for future features.
